- Add a site-level quota feature. On the welcome form you get at the
  Zope root, you can configure a site-level quota for a given
  site. This quota cannot be changed from within the site.

- Various services are now configurable in SMI under Site preferences.

- Silva Ghost Asset have been added. They are ghost content for
  assets. When ghosting a Folder, Silva Ghost Asset will be created

  - Regarding broken links and broken ghost.

  - Allow empty string as resize specifier for images.

  mimetypes.

  is set. It is now set on contents at the end of the request, just
  before the content is being re-index. This feature is disabled
  during upgrade (the last modification date and author are not set on
  content during upgrades).

  image is missing).

- Add a name chooser for Zope contents, that is used by the Silva Root
